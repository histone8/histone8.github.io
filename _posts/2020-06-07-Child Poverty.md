In 2018/19 the UK had 4.2 million children living in poverty. That is 30% of children, thus in a hypothetical class of 30 children 9 of them would be living in poverty. Unfortunately, this number is only predicted to increase in the next years. Moreover, ethnic minorities and black children are more likely to live in poverty compared to children of white British families. It needs to be taken into consideration that 72% of the children living in poverty have a parent that works (Child poverty facts and figures, 2020). This short essay aims to provide clarity and prospective on what the implication of poverty are and their effects on children. 

Child poverty is not only a temporary problem for the children living in it, but has profound implication on the child health, cognitive development, behaviour and social life, later in life (Wickham et al., 2016). For example, studies show that children who experienced poverty growing up have a higher risk of death compared to adults who grew up in an economic sufficient household (Wickham et al., 2016). The higher risk of death is present in almost all conditions that were studied such as stomach cancer, lung cancer, haemorrhagic stroke, coronary heart disease and respiratory-related deaths, accidents, and alcohol (Wickham et al., 2016). 

Sharkins and colleagues published, in 2016, their findings about the components that affect linguistic and cognitive development in children that live in poverty. Their study suggests the child’s social-emotional wellbeing and fine motor development can impact linguistic and cognitive development. The caregivers’ educational level also effects the child development (Sharkins et al., 2017). Furthermore, children in poverty are three times more likely to be maltreated compared to children in economically stable families. To explain the correlation between poverty and unfavourable family outcomes (for example child abuse, parent separation, low school achievements, no family activities) the Family Stress Model of Economic Hardship is used. This model explains that poverty can cause anxiety, depression and stress in a person, thus children living in poverty not only are affected by the absence of material goods, but also by increased parent hostility and inconsistent and harsh discipline practices (Maguire-Jack & Font, 2017). Maguire-Jack and Font found that neighbourhood poverty is correlated to neglect regardless of parent/s economic status. Living in an affluent neighbourhood does not completely change this neglect dynamic for low-income families. Physical neglect (includes food & medical needs) levels are reduced in affluent neighbours, but other forms of maltreatment are unchanged (Maguire-Jack & Font, 2017). 
  
Everyday families living in poverty are faced everyday with difficult decision, and a they have a lot to lose if the decision made does not lead to the desired consequences (Cedeño et al., 2016). For example, they might need to decide id to pay gas or electricity for that month, or between rent and food. These daily difficulties promote the activation of a survival mechanisms that makes parents who live in poverty disregard some need that are not essential, like children supervision (Cedeño et al., 2016). As previously explained poverty causes children to be at higher risks of maltreatment, and poor environments are usually chaotic and stressful. Stress is a very important factor that has detrimental consequences on the people effected, evidence suggest that stress is correlated with overactivity of the amygdala (control of fear response) and lower activity of the hippocampus (memory formation) which results in compromised cognitive control (Cedeño et al., 2016)(Figure1). It is thought that poor environments also generate lower cognitive abilities for developing children because the child is exposed to less books, toys, and less visits to cultural places like museums (Cedeño et al., 2016). Moreover, parents are less concerned with the cognitive abilities and the vocabulary richness of the child; this discrepancy in everyday experiences between poor and economically stable children can be ultimately visualized at work or school. Additionally, chronic stress can lead to changes in genetic expression that can hinder the health and lifespan of the person, in children chronic stress effects attachment, and self-regulation and learning (Cedeño et al., 2016). Learning is compromised because chronic stress negatively effects attention, working memory, planning and decision-making (Cedeño et al., 2016). However, the brain plasticity allows for the correction of maladaptive behaviours so a change in the environment and increased parental involvement or general increase in support for a child living in poverty can have a significant and long lasting effect for the better.

*Figure1: Poverty caused stress effects. HPA Reactivity= hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. A stressful environment causes the release of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) form the hypothalamus; the CRH stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormones (ACH). The ACH stimulates the adrenal glands sitting above the kidneys to secrete adrenaline and cortisol. This is why this pathway is called HPA axis.* 


In conclusion children that are living in unfavourable condition are, as a result, more likely to have a lower quality of life and lower life achievements compared to their peers living in economically stable families. As it was discussed economic difficulties cause stress which in turn can cause health issues and compromised mental function that hinder the parent’s ability to assist their children. This creates a cycle within poorer communities that results in families remaining in those living condition for generations. This is systemic problem in our society and should be looked at as major and urgent.
